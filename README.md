The main goal was to learn how to create and add elements to a page with JavaScript. I have used Vite instead of Webpack.

By completing the Restaurant Page project from The Odin Project, I have learned the following skills:

- How to create and style a website using HTML and CSS
- How to use the position, display, and flexbox properties in CSS to layout elements on a page
- How to use the :hover pseudo-class in CSS to change the appearance of elements when the user hovers over them
- How to use JavaScript to add interactivity to a website, such as changing the content of a page when the user clicks on a link
- How to use the document.createElement and appendChild methods in JavaScript to create and add elements to a page
- How to work with DOM elements in JavaScript and use event listeners to respond to user actions
- How to use functions and modules to organize and reuse code in a project



The Website is not responsive at this moment.
